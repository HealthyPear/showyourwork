.. code-block:: bash

    Let's get you set up with a new repository. I'm going to create a folder called

        article 

    in the current working directory. If you haven't done this yet, please visit

        https://github.com/new 

    at this time and create an empty repository called

        rodluger/article

    Press any key to continue, or Ctrl+C to abort...



.. code-block:: bash

    I didn't find a ZENODO_TOKEN environment variable, so I'm not going to set up
    a Zenodo deposit for caching intermediate results. If you would like to enable
    this, please go to

        https://zenodo.org/account/settings/applications/tokens/new

    to create a new personal access token with deposit:actions and deposit:write
    scopes, store it in a local ZENODO_TOKEN environment variable, and re-run this
    setup script.

    Press any key to continue, or Ctrl+C to abort...



.. code-block:: bash

    You didn't provide an Overleaf project id (via the --overleaf command-line
    option), so I'm not going to set up Overleaf integration for this repository.

    Press any key to continue, or Ctrl+C to abort...
