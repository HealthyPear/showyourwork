To-do
-----

A list of things we should fix/implement before the first major release.

- [ ] Regarding Zenodo deposits with tarballs containing lots of files:
      consider supporting directories (instead of specific files) in the ``contents`` mapping of
      the config file.
- [ ] Don't show errors on make clean
- [ ] Add option to create new Zenodo deposit for a branch
- [ ] Test uploads of very large files
- [ ] Implement showyourwork publish (for Zenodo)
- [ ] Support .zip files on Zenodo
