To-do
-----

A list of things we should fix/implement before the first major release.

- [ ] Fix `cli` and `zenodo` docs pages.
- [ ] Get rid of the ``showyourwork`` section of the config file.
- [ ] Regarding Zenodo deposits with tarballs containing lots of files:
      consider supporting directories (instead of specific files) in the 
      ``contents`` mapping of the config file.
- [ ] Test uploads of very large files
