## To-do

A list of things we should fix/implement before the first major release.

- [ ] Implement `showyourwork cache publish`
- [ ] Fix docs
- [ ] Regarding Zenodo deposits with tarballs containing lots of files: consider supporting directories (instead of specific files) in the `contents` mapping of the config file.
